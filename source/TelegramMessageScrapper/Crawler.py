"""
This is an updated version of the so-called "Scrapper" class, which is responsible for collecting messages from Telegram channels.
This version includes improvements in the code structure, error handling, and logging.

Main differences:
1. Improved error handling: The code now includes more specific error handling for different exceptions that may occur during the message collection process.
2. Enhanced logging: The logging messages have been improved to provide more context and clarity about the actions being performed.
3. Reimagined class logic: Now the class does not STORE its messages. Instead, when we have a request in a "RetrievalAugmentedResponse" Object we add to this object newly gathered messages.

Also, this message handling may increase load on api. To ensure that we do not exceed the limits, we have to add a channel caching.
It is not straight storing, rather TTL (Time To Live) cache, which will store the last channels that have been requested.
